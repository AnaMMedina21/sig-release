various interdependent repositories that need to be updated in tandem.

## Audience

Updating Go is intended to be handled by a member of the
[Release Managers][release-managers] group.

There are a variety of touchpoints in this process that require special access
to debug potential failures, which are restricted to Release Managers.

## Scope

This handbook is intended to cover both minor and patch Golang version updates.

- Minor version upgrade: `x.y.z` --> `x.y+N.z`, where `N` is usually `1`
- Patch version upgrade: `x.y.z` --> `x.y.z+N`, where `N` is usually `1`

While the mechanics of a minor and patch are primarily the same, be aware that
a minor version update _may_ require:

- code changes to `kubernetes/kubernetes`
- coordination across multiple SIGs/subprojects to attain reviews/approvals for
  various code areas
- coordination with external projects e.g., golang, etcd
- extended lead time to merge (rebases, mending test failures)

**Please pair with a more senior Release Manager if you find yourself working
on a minor version update.**

## Signaling intent

Before you get started, it's important to inform a few groups that you will be
working on a Golang update.

Some broad requirements (which can be expanded as we get more people involved):

- Open an issue in `kubernetes/release` to track the work
  - Examples:
    - https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/1216
    - https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/1257
- Tag `@kubernetes/release-engineering` in the tracking issue
- (For minor updates) Tag [SIG Scalability Chairs/Technical Leads](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability#leadership) in the tracking issue
