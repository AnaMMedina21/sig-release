## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Docker runtime support using dockershim in the kubelet is now completely removed in 1.24. The kubelet used to have a module called dockershim, which implements CRI support for Docker, and it has seen maintenance issues in the Kubernetes community. From 1.24 onwards, please move to a container runtime that is a full-fledged implementation of CRI (v1alpha1 or v1 compliant) as they become available. ([#97252](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97252), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
 - Fixed bug with leads to Node goes `Not-ready` state when credentials for vCenter stored in a secret and Zones feature is in use. Zone labels setup moved to KCM component, kubelet skips this step during startup in such case. If credentials stored in cloud-provider config file as plaintext current behaviour does not change and no action required. For proper functioning `kube-system:vsphere-legacy-cloud-provider` should be allowed to update node object if vCenter credentials stored in secret and Zone feature used. ([#101028](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101028), [@lobziik](https://github.com/lobziik))
 - The calculations for Pod topology spread skew now exclude nodes that
  don't match the node affinity/selector. This may lead to unschedulable pods if you previously had pods
  matching the spreading selector on those excluded nodes (not matching the node affinity/selector),
  especially when the `topologyKey` is not node-level. Revisit the node affinity and/or pod selector in the
  topology spread constraints to avoid this scenario. ([#107009](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107009), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet))
 
## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

- Cluster addon for dashboard was removed. To install dashboard, see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/docs/user/README.md). ([#107481](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107481), [@shu-mutou](https://github.com/shu-mutou))
- Deprecated `Service.Spec.LoadBalancerIP`. This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.  As of Kubernetes v1.24, users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.  This field may be removed in a future API version. ([#107235](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235), [@uablrek](https://github.com/uablrek))
- Kube-apiserver: the `--master-count` flag and `--endpoint-reconciler-type=master-count` reconciler are deprecated in favor of the lease reconciler ([#108062](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108062), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Kube-apiserver: the insecure address flags `--address`, `--insecure-bind-address`, `--port` and `--insecure-port` (inert since 1.20) are removed ([#106859](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106859), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42))
- Kubeadm: graduated the `UnversionedKubeletConfigMap` feature gate to Beta and enabled the feature by default. This implies that 1) for new clusters kubeadm will start using the `kube-system/kubelet-config` naming scheme for the kubelet ConfigMap and RBAC rules, instead of the legacy `kubelet-config-x.yy` naming. 2) during upgrade, kubeadm will only write the new scheme ConfigMap and RBAC objects. To disable the feature you can pass `UnversionedKubeletConfigMap: false` in the kubeadm config for new clusters. For upgrade on existing clusters you can also override the behavior by patching the ClusterConfiguration object in `kube-system/kubeadm-config`. More details in the associated KEP. ([#108027](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108027), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Remove `tolerate-unready-endpoints` annotation in Service deprecated from 1.11, use `Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses` instead. ([#108020](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108020), [@tossmilestone](https://github.com/tossmilestone))
- The experimental dynamic log sanitization feature has been deprecated and removed in the 1.24 release. The feature is no longer available for use. ([#107207](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107207), [@ehashman](https://github.com/ehashman))
- The in-tree azure plugin has been deprecated.  The https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin serves as an out-of-tree replacement via the kubectl/client-go credential plugin mechanism.  Users will now see a warning in the logs regarding this deprecation. ([#107904](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107904), [@sabbey37](https://github.com/sabbey37))
- The insecure address flags `--address` and `--port` in kube-controller-manager have had no effect since v1.20 and are removed in v1.24. ([#106860](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106860), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42))
- `kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release, possibly in 3 releases (one year). You should start using `kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3` for new clusters. To migrate your old configuration files on disk you can use the `kubeadm config migrate` command. ([#107013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107013), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))

### API Change

- Added a new metric `webhook_fail_open_count` to monitor webhooks that fail to open. ([#107171](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107171), [@ltagliamonte-dd](https://github.com/ltagliamonte-dd))
- CRD deep copies should no longer contain shallow copies of `JSONSchemaProps.XValidations`. ([#107956](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107956), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy))
- Feature of `NonPreemptingPriority` is graduated  to GA ([#107432](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107432), [@denkensk](https://github.com/denkensk))

- The feature `DynamicKubeletConfig` has been removed from the kubelet. ([#106932](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106932), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev))
- Updated the default API priority-and-fairness config to avoid endpoint/configmaps operations from controller-manager to all match leader-election priority level. ([#106725](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106725), [@wojtek-t](https://github.com/wojtek-t))

### Feature

- A new Priority and Fairness metric 'apiserver_flowcontrol_work_estimate_seats_samples' has been added that tracks the estimated seats associated with a request. ([#106628](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106628), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem))
- Added `SetTransform` to `SharedInformer` to allow users to transform objects before they are stored. ([#107507](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107507), [@alexzielenski](https://github.com/alexzielenski))

([#106629](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106629), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem))
- Added a path `/header?key=` to `agnhost netexec` allowing one to view what the header value is of the incoming request.
  
  Ex:
  
  ```$ curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: something" 172.17.0.2:8080/header?key=X-Forwarded-For
  something``` ([#107796](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107796), [@alexanderConstantinescu](https://github.com/alexanderConstantinescu))
- Added completion for `kubectl config set-context`. ([#106739](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106739), [@kebe7jun](https://github.com/kebe7jun))
- Added field `add_ambient_capabilities` to the Capabilities message in the CRI-API. ([#104620](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104620), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal))
- Added label selector flag to all `kubectl rollout` commands. ([#99758](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99758), [@aramperes](https://github.com/aramperes))
- Added more message for no PodSandbox container. ([#107116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107116), [@yxxhero](https://github.com/yxxhero))
- Added prune flag into diff command to simulate `apply --prune`. ([#105164](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105164), [@ardaguclu](https://github.com/ardaguclu))

- Feature of `PreferNominatedNode` is graduated to GA. ([#106619](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106619), [@chendave](https://github.com/chendave))
- In text format, log messages that previously used quoting to prevent multi-line output (for example, text="some \"quotation\", a\nline break") will now be printed with more readable multi-line output without the escape sequences. ([#107103](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107103), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Kube-apiserver: when merging lists, Server Side Apply now prefers the order of the submitted request instead of the existing persisted object. ([#107565](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107565), [@jiahuif](https://github.com/jiahuif))
- Kubeadm: added support for dry running `kubeadm reset`. The new flag `kubeadm reset --dry-run` is similar to the existing flag for `kubeadm init/join/upgrade` and allows you to see what changes would be applied. ([#107512](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107512), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: default the kubeadm configuration to the containerd socket (Unix: `unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock`, Windows: `npipe:////./pipe/containerd-containerd`) instead of the one for Docker. If the `Init|JoinConfiguration.nodeRegistration.criSocket` field is empty during cluster creation and multiple sockets are found on the host always throw an error and ask the user to specify which one to use by setting the value in the field. Make sure you update any kubeadm configuration files on disk, to not include the dockershim socket unless you are still using kubelet version < 1.24 with kubeadm >= 1.24.
  
  Remove the DockerValidor and ServiceCheck for the `docker` service from kubeadm preflight. Docker is no longer special cased during host validation and ideally this task should be done in the now external cri-dockerd project where the importance of the compatibility matters.
  
  Use `crictl` for all communication with CRI sockets for actions like pulling images and obtaining a list of running containers instead of using the docker CLI in the case of Docker. ([#107317](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107317), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubelet: the following dockershim related flags are also removed along with dockershim `--experimental-dockershim-root-directory`, `--docker-endpoint`, `--image-pull-progress-deadline`, `--network-plugin`, `--cni-conf-dir`, `--cni-bin-dir`, `--cni-cache-dir`, `--network-plugin-mtu`.

- The `kubectl logs` will now warn and default to the first container in a pod. This new behavior brings it in line with `kubectl exec`. ([#105964](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105964), [@kidlj](https://github.com/kidlj))
- The output of `kubectl describe ingress` now includes an IngressClass name if available. ([#107921](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107921), [@mpuckett159](https://github.com/mpuckett159))
- The scheduler prints info logs when the extender returned an error. (--v>5) ([#107974](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107974), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho))

- Metrics Server image bumped to v0.5.2 ([#106492](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106492), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius))
- Modified command line errors (for example, `kubectl list` -> `unknown command`) that were printed as log message with escaped line breaks instead of a multi-line plain text, making the error hard to read. ([#107044](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107044), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Modified log messages that were logged with `"v":0` in JSON output although they were debug messages with a higher verbosity. ([#106978](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106978), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- No ([#107769](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107769), [@liurupeng](https://github.com/liurupeng)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Windows]
- NodeRestriction admission: nodes are now allowed to update PersistentVolumeClaim status fields `resizeStatus` and `allocatedResources` when the `RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure` feature is enabled. ([#107686](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107686), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied))
- Only extend token lifetimes when `--service-account-extend-token-expiration` is true and the requested token audiences are empty or exactly match all values for `--api-audiences`. ([#105954](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105954), [@jyotimahapatra](https://github.com/jyotimahapatra))
- Publishing kube-proxy metrics for Windows kernel-mode ([#106581](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106581), [@knabben](https://github.com/knabben))
- Removed validation if AppArmor profiles are loaded on the local node. This should be handled by the
  container runtime. ([#97966](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97966), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Restored `NumPDBViolations` info of nodes, when `HTTPExtender ProcessPreemption`. This info will be used in subsequent filtering steps - `pickOneNodeForPreemption` ([#105853](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105853), [@caden2016](https://github.com/caden2016))
- Reverts graceful node shutdown to match 1.21 behavior of setting pods that have not yet successfully completed to "Failed" phase if the GracefulNodeShutdown feature is enabled in kubelet. The GracefulNodeShutdown feature is beta and must be explicitly configured via kubelet config to be enabled in 1.21+. This changes 1.22 and 1.23 behavior on node shutdown to match 1.21. If you do not want pods to be marked terminated on node shutdown in 1.22 and 1.23, disable the GracefulNodeShutdown feature. ([#106901](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106901), [@bobbypage](https://github.com/bobbypage))
- Reverts the CRI API version surfaced by dockershim to v1alpha2 ([#106803](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106803), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- The Service field `spec.internalTrafficPolicy` is no longer defaulted for Services when the type is `ExternalName`. The field is also dropped on read when the Service type is `ExternalName`. ([#104846](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104846), [@andrewsykim](https://github.com/andrewsykim))
- The deprecated flag `--really-crash-for-testing` was removed. ([#101719](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101719), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev))
- The feature gate was mentioned as `csiMigrationRBD` where it should have been `CSIMigrationRBD` to be in parity with other migration plugins. This release correct the same and keep it as `CSIMigrationRBD`.
  
  users who have configured this feature gate as `csiMigrationRBD` has to reconfigure the same to `CSIMigrationRBD` from this release. ([#107554](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107554), [@humblec](https://github.com/humblec))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- Added an e2e test to verify that the cluster is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-29923 when using Services with IPs with leading zeros, note that this test is a necessary but not sufficient condition, all the components in the clusters that consume IPs addresses from the APIs MUST interpret them as decimal or discard them. ([#107552](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107552), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Added an example for the `kubectl plugin list` command. ([#106600](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106600), [@bergerhoffer](https://github.com/bergerhoffer))
- Added details about preemption in the event for scheduling failed. ([#107775](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107775), [@denkensk](https://github.com/denkensk))
- Build/dependencies.yaml: remove the dependency on Docker. With the dockershim removal, core Kubernetes no longer
  has to track the latest validated version of Docker. ([#107607](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107607), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Deprecated types in `k8s.io/apimachinery/util/clock`. Please use `k8s.io/utils/clock` instead. ([#106850](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106850), [@MadhavJivrajani](https://github.com/MadhavJivrajani))
- E2e tests wait for `kube-root-ca.crt` to be populated in namespaces for use with projected service account tokens, reducing delays starting those test pods and errors in the logs. ([#107763](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107763), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))
- Fixed documentation typo in cloud-provider. ([#106445](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106445), [@majst01](https://github.com/majst01))
- Fixed spelling of implemented in pkg/proxy/apis/config/types.go line 206 ([#106453](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106453), [@davidleitw](https://github.com/davidleitw))
- Kubeadm: all warning messages are printed to stderr instead of stdout. ([#107467](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107467), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: handled the removal of dockershim related flags for new kubeadm clusters. If kubelet <1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 can continue using the built-in dockershim in the kubelet if the user passes the `{Init|Join}Configuration.nodeRegistration.criSocket` value in the kubeadm configuration to be equal to `unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock` on Unix or `npipe:////./pipe/dockershim` on Windows. If kubelet version >=1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 will treat all container runtimes as "remote" using the kubelet flags `--container-runtime=remote --container-runtime-endpoint=scheme://some/path`. The special management for kubelet <1.24 will be removed in kubeadm 1.25. ([#106973](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106973), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: make sure that `kubeadm init/join` always use a URL scheme (unix:// on Linux and npipe:// on Windows) when passing a value to the `--container-runtime-endpoint` kubelet flag. This flag's value is taken from the kubeadm configuration `criSocket` field or the `--cri-socket` CLI flag. Automatically add a missing URL scheme to the user configuration in memory, but warn them that they should also update their configuration on disk manually. During `kubeadm upgrade apply/node` mutate the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file on disk and the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation Node object if needed. These automatic actions are temporary and will be removed in a future release. In the future the kubelet may not support CRI endpoints without an URL scheme.

- Kubeadm: remove the `IPv6DualStack` feature gate. The feature has been GA and locked to enabled since 1.23. ([#106648](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106648), [@calvin0327](https://github.com/calvin0327))
- Kubeadm: removed the deprecated `output/v1alpha1` API used for machine readable output by some kubeadm commands. In 1.23 kubeadm started using the newer version `output/v1alpha2` for the same purpose. ([#107468](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107468), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: removed the restriction that the `ca.crt` can only contain one certificate. If there is more than one certificate in the `ca.crt` file, kubeadm will pick the first one by default. ([#107327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107327), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubectl stack traces now only print at verbose -v=99 and not -v=6 ([#108053](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108053), [@eddiezane](https://github.com/eddiezane))
- Kubectl: restored `--dry-run`, `--dry-run=true`, and `--dry-run=false` for compatibility with pre-1.23 invocations. ([#107003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107003), [@julianvmodesto](https://github.com/julianvmodesto))
- Kubelet config validation error messages are updated ([#105360](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105360), [@shuheiktgw](https://github.com/shuheiktgw))
- Kubernetes e2e framework will use the url `invalid.registry.k8s.io/invalid` instead `invalid.com/invalid` for test that use an invalid registry. ([#107455](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107455), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Marked kubelet `--container-runtime-endpoint` and `--image-service-endpoint` CLI flags as stable. ([#106954](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106954), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Migrate `volume/csi/csi-client.go` logs to structured logging. ([#99441](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99441), [@CKchen0726](https://github.com/CKchen0726))
- Refactor kubelet command line for enabling features and "drop `RuntimeClass` feature gate" if present. Note that this feature has been on by default since 1.14 and was GA'ed in 1.20. ([#106882](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106882), [@cyclinder](https://github.com/cyclinder))
- Removed kubelet `--non-masquerade-cidr` deprecated CLI flag ([#107096](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107096), [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman))
- The `--container-runtime` kubelet flag is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. ([#107094](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107094), [@adisky](https://github.com/adisky))
- The fluentd-elasticsearch addon is no longer included in the cluster directory. It is available from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/instrumentation-addons/tree/master/fluentd-elasticsearch. ([#107553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107553), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Updated cri-tools to [v1.23.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/releases/tag/v1.23.0). ([#107604](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107604), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- Updated the error message to not use the `--max-resource-write-bytes` & `--json-patch-max-copy-bytes` string. ([#106875](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106875), [@warmchang](https://github.com/warmchang))
- [k8s.io/utils/clock]: IntervalClock is now deprecated in favour of SimpleIntervalClock ([#108059](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108059), [@RaghavRoy145](https://github.com/RaghavRoy145))
