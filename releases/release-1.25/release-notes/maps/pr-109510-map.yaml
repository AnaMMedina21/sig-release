  text: This change picks up the latest GCE pinhole firewall feature, which introduces
    destination-ranges in the ingress firewall-rules. It restricts the access to the
    backend IPs via allowing traffic via allowing traffic through ILB or NetLB IP
    only. This change does NOT change the existing ILB or NetLB behavior.
