  text: 'kubeadm: modify the etcd static Pod liveness and readyness probes to use
    a new etcd 3.5.3+ HTTP(s) health check endpoint "/health?serializable=true" that
    allows to track the health of individual etcd members and not fail all members
    if a single member is not healthy in the etcd cluster.'
